# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It's me, JÃ¸ran Engelund :smile:

## About me:
> I live and eat in Oslo, Norway. I am currently at full-time studies as a front-end developer at Noroff Vocational School of Technology and Digital Media. I started this studies because in the latter years I have found coding to be a passion. In my youth, I created what we called "home-pages" aka blogs, where you can create your own media-website through a CMS with a strict set of tools.

> I find front-end as giving, creative and exciting as I can see ideas, solutions and designs unfold and be created before my eyes, like a digital carpenter. I find solving problems and discussing various solutions as a mind game and it is mildly said, a thrill. In my free-time, I'm usually driving on my motorcycle either if it's the country roads or a track.

## My interests:
- At my free time, I like driving around on my motorcycle
- I enjoy playing disc golf
- I follow sports like MotoGP, NBA and the Norwegian national team in football
- I like to watch live shows
- Watching a movie in the evening is hard to beat
- Strategy games are a good mind stimuli
